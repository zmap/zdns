ZDNS
====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zmap/zdns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zmap/zdns)


ZDNS is a command-line utility that provides high-speed DNS lookups. For
example, the following will perform MX lookups and a secondary A lookup for the
IPs of MX servers for the domains in the Alexa Top Million:

	cat top-1m.csv | zdns MX --ipv4-lookup --alexa

ZDNS is written in golang and is primarily based on https://github.com/miekg/dns.

Install
=======

ZDNS can be installed by running:

	go get github.com/zmap/zdns/zdns


Usage
=====

ZDNS provides several types of modules.

Raw DNS Modules
---------------

The `A`, `AAAA`, `ANY`, `AXFR`, `CAA`, `CNAME`, `DMARC`, `MX`, `NS`, `PTR`, `TXT`,
`SOA`, and `SPF` modules provide the raw DNS response in JSON form, similar to dig.

For example, the command:

	echo "censys.io" | zdns A

returns:
```json
{
  "name": "censys.io",
  "class": "IN",
  "status": "NOERROR",
  "data": {
    "answers": [
      {
        "ttl": 300,
        "type": "A",
        "class": "IN",
        "name": "censys.io",
        "data": "216.239.38.21"
      }
    ],
    "additionals": [
      {
        "ttl": 34563,
        "type": "A",
        "class": "IN",
        "name": "ns-cloud-e1.googledomains.com",
        "data": "216.239.32.110"
      },
    ],
    "authorities": [
      {
        "ttl": 53110,
        "type": "NS",
        "class": "IN",
        "name": "censys.io",
        "data": "ns-cloud-e1.googledomains.com."
      },
    ],
    "protocol": "udp"
  }
}
```

Lookup Modules
--------------

Raw DNS responses frequently do not provide the data you _want_. For example,
an MX response may not include the associated A records in the additionals
section requiring an additional lookup. To address this gap and provide a
friendlier interface, we also provide several _lookup_ modules: `alookup` and
`mxlookup`.

`mxlookup` will additionally do an A lookup for the IP addresses that
correspond with an exchange record. `alookup` acts similar to nslookup and will
follow CNAME records.

For example,

	echo "censys.io" | ./zdns mxlookup --ipv4-lookup

returns:
```json
{
  "name": "censys.io",
  "status": "NOERROR",
  "data": {
    "exchanges": [
      {
        "name": "aspmx.l.google.com",
        "type": "MX",
        "class": "IN",
        "preference": 1,
        "ipv4_addresses": [
          "74.125.28.26"
        ],
        "ttl": 288
      },
      {
        "name": "alt1.aspmx.l.google.com",
        "type": "MX",
        "class": "IN",
        "preference": 5,
        "ipv4_addresses": [
          "64.233.182.26"
        ],
        "ttl": 288
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Local Recursion
---------------

ZDNS can either operate against a recursive resolver (e.g., an organizational
DNS server) [default behavior] or can perform its own recursion internally. To
perform local recursion, run zdns with the `--iterative` flag. When this flag
is used, ZDNS will round-robin between the published root servers (e.g.,
198.41.0.4). In iterative mode, you can control the size of the local cache by
specifying `--cache-size` and the timeout for individual iterations by setting
`--iteration-timeout`. The `--timeout` flag controls the timeout of the entire
resolution for a given input (i.e., the sum of all iterative steps).

Running ZDNS
------------

By default, ZDNS will operate with 1,000 light-weight go routines. If you're
not careful, this will overwhelm many upstream DNS providers. We suggest that
users coordinate with local network administrators before performing any scans.
You can control the number of concurrent connections with the `--threads` and
`--go-processes` command line arguments. Alternate name servers can be
specified with `--name-servers`. ZDNS will rotate through these servers when
making requests.

Unsupported Types
-----------------

If zdns encounters a record type it does not support it will generate an output
record with the `type` field set correctly and a representation of the
underlying data structure in the `unparsed_rr` field. Do not rely on the
presence or structure of this field. This field (and its existence) may change
at any time as we expand support for additional record types. If you find
yourself using this field, please consider submitting a pull-request adding
parser support.
