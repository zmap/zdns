ZDNS
====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zmap/zdns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zmap/zdns)


ZDNS is a command-line utility that provides high-speed DNS lookups. For
example, the following will perform MX lookups and a secondary A lookup for the
IPs of MX servers for the domains in the Alexa Top Million:

	cat top-1m.csv | zdns MX --lookup-ipv4 --alexa

ZDNS is written in golang and is primarily based on https://github.com/miekg/dns.

Install
=======

ZDNS can be installed by running:

	go get github.com/zmap/zdns/zdns


Usage
=====

ZDNS provides several types of modules.

Raw DNS Modules
---------------

The `A`, `AAAA`, `ANY`, `AXFR`, `CNAME`, `DMARC`, `MX`, `NS`, `PTR`, `TXT`,
`SOA`, and `SPF` modules provide the raw DNS response in JSON form, similar to dig.

For example, the command:

	echo "censys.io" | zdns A

returns:
```json
{
  "name": "censys.io",
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "answers": [
      {
        "ttl": 300,
        "type": "A",
        "name": "censys.io",
        "data": "216.239.38.21"
      }
    ],
    "additionals": [
      {
        "ttl": 34563,
        "type": "A",
        "name": "ns-cloud-e1.googledomains.com",
        "data": "216.239.32.110"
      },
    ],
    "authorities": [
      {
        "ttl": 53110,
        "type": "NS",
        "name": "censys.io",
        "data": "ns-cloud-e1.googledomains.com."
      },
    ],
    "protocol": "udp"
  }
}
```

Lookup Modules
--------------

Raw DNS responses frequently do not provide the data you _want_. For example,
an MX response may not include the associated A records in the additionals
section requiring an additional lookup. To address this gap and provide a
friendlier interface, we also provide several _lookup_ modules: `alookup` and
`mxlookup`.

`mxlookup` will additionally do an A lookup for the IP addresses that
correspond with an exchange record. `alookup` acts similar to nslookup and will
follow CNAME records.

For example,

	echo "censys.io" | ./zdns mxlookup --ipv4-lookup

returns:
```json
{
  "name": "censys.io",
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "exchanges": [
      {
        "name": "aspmx.l.google.com",
        "type": "MX",
        "preference": 1,
        "ipv4_addresses": [
          "74.125.28.26"
        ],
        "ttl": 288
      },
      {
        "name": "alt1.aspmx.l.google.com",
        "type": "MX",
        "preference": 5,
        "ipv4_addresses": [
          "64.233.182.26"
        ],
        "ttl": 288
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Zone File Modules
-----------------

The above modules are useful when we only have a list of domain names to perform queries
for. However, in some instances we have a root zone file that indicates all domains in a
zone, and their nameservers. For this instance, we have the `zone` module.

The `zone` module performs an `alookup` for each domain in the specified zone file,
skipping as much of the recursive lookup as is possible. This entails utilization of the
glue records in the zone file to go directly to the domain's authoritative nameserver,
as well as caching nameserver locations when lookups must be performed.

For example, if the following two records are in a zonefile,

	foo.com. NS ns.foo.com.
	ns.foo.com. A XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

then the resulting lookup for foo.com will utilize the nameserver at XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

This is useful for performing many `alookup` calls without hammering the local and root
nameservers.

Note: the `zone` module requires the --input-file flag be set, in order to allow it to
make two passes over the input.

Running ZDNS
------------

By default, ZDNS will operate with 1,000 light-weight go routines. If you're
not careful, this will overwhelm many upstream DNS providers. We suggest that
users coordinate with local network administrators before performing any scans.
You can control the number of concurrent connections with the `--threads` and
`--go-processes` command line arguments. Alternate name servers can be
specified with `--name-servers`. ZDNS will rotate through these servers when
making requests.
